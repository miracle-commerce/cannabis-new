	For non-content pages (e.g. password, cart, customers pages, etc.) we want to show some limited, basic output, as we
	don't expect anyone will want to share these pages and this content also shouldn't be crawled by search engines.

	Content pages:
	- index
	- product
	- product_archive
	- product_tags
	- collection
	- collection_archive
	- list-collections
	- page
	- blog
	- article
	- blog_post_tags
	- search
	- 404
	- policy
	endcomment

	assign output_type = 'basic'
	assign non_basic_page_types = "index,product,product_archive,product_tags,collection,collection_archive,list-collections,page,blog,article,blog_post_tags,search,404,policy"

	capture yoast_seo_page_type
		render 'yoast-seo-page-type'
	endcapture

	if non_basic_page_types contains yoast_seo_page_type
		assign output_type = ''
